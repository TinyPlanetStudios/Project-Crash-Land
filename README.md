# Project-Crash-Land

This is the complete source for Tiny Planet (Codename Project Crash Land)

If you want to build it yourself then ignore the export folder but take everything else. the export folders contain working versions of all the build types used though they may not be 100% up to date (the source is though)

You will need haxe, and haxflixel if you plan to build this code but the executables in the export folder will run without.

The game can also be found at https://grimmr.itch.io/tiny-planet, if you would like to see what it's like without downloading.
